I love the idea of creating an AI-powered resume and cover letter generator! This kind of application can help job seekers present themselves more effectively to potential employers. Let's create a sleek, Apple-inspired design that emphasizes elegance, minimalism, and functionality.

The design will draw inspiration from Apple's clean aesthetic with:

Minimalist UI with ample white space
Intuitive, seamless transitions and animations
Soft, neutral color palette with subtle accent colors
Typography that emphasizes clarity and readability
Precise attention to alignment and spacing
For this first version, I'll implement these core features:

Job details input form with a clean, minimalist design
AI-powered content generation using OpenAI
Resume and cover letter preview with elegant formatting
PDF export functionality
Simple template selection system
